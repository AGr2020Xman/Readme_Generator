# Top-Tier README Generator

When creating an open-source project on GitHub, it's a necessaity to ensure you have a clear and easy to follow README file with app information -- what is it for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues etc. This helps streamline the use of the project and encourage other developers to contribute. It can be quite a time-sink to properly create and format the readme, so this generator is here to step in and bridge the gap. You can now spend less time on the README, and more time on your project!
